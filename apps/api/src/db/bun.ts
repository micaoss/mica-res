// ─── Write serialization ───
//
// libsql's `transaction()` holds one pooled connection — and SQLite's write
// lock, since drizzle opens it with BEGIN IMMEDIATE — across every `await` in
// the transaction body. A write from another request meanwhile lands on a
// second connection and meets that lock. Two things can then happen, and
// both are wrong:
//
//  - with no busy timeout it fails at once with SQLITE_BUSY, so any two
//    modules that happen to write together produce a 500;
//  - with a busy timeout it waits inside SQLite, and libsql executes
//    synchronously, so the wait blocks the event loop. The transaction it is
//    waiting for needs that same loop to commit, so it never does, and the
//    write fails anyway once the timeout has frozen the whole server.
//
// So contention inside this process is resolved before SQLite sees it: a
// transaction holds an async lock for its whole life, and a write outside a
// transaction takes the same lock for its one statement. Reads skip it — in
// WAL mode they never block on a writer.
