 * Routes served on the raw API, `${BASE_PATH}/api/raw/*`.

 * This is the surface for other services to integrate with, so it carries
 * none of the browser-facing protections the `/api` routes get: no security
 * headers, no CSRF guard, no CORS policy, no session or policy middleware.
 * The only protection applied to every route here is a per-client rate limit
 * (see `buildRawApp`). Anything that needs authentication must check it
 * itself — a service token in a header is the usual shape.
 *
 * Mount a module's open routes below, the same way `protected.ts` mounts
 * session-authenticated ones.
