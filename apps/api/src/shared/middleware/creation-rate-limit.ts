 * Per-user throttle on creating content, backed by the `rate_limits` table.
 *
 * Mounted once, globally. It finds the creating routes itself (see
 * `discoverCreationRoutes`) rather than being wired into each one, so a new
 * module is throttled as soon as it is mounted and nobody has to remember
 * to opt in.
 *
 * Budgets are per resource: a burst of comments does not spend the budget
 * for opening issues, and a runaway loop in one module cannot lock a user
 * out of the rest of the app. `CREATE_RATE_LIMIT_EXEMPT` lists resources to
 * leave alone.
 *
 * Two windows are enforced together: `CREATE_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE` bounds a
 * burst, and `CREATE_RATE_LIMIT_PER_HOUR` bounds the sustained rate a burst
 * limit alone would still allow. Either at `0` disables that window.
 * Rejected requests keep counting, so sustained abuse escalates out of the
 * minute window into the hour one rather than settling into a comfortable
 * rhythm just under the burst cap.
 *
 * Creation is the surface where an authenticated caller can grow the
 * database without bound, so the counters live in the database rather than
 * in memory: an in-memory window dies with the process, and a caller can
 * pace requests around a restart — or, on a runtime that evicts the app when
 * idle, around the eviction. Keying on the user id bounds the table to
 * users × resources × windows, one row each, overwritten in place.
