# Architecture

> Examples assume `BASE_PATH=/app`. The app is mounted at root (`/`) by default; set `BASE_PATH` to serve under a URL prefix.

This is a Bun monorepo template that provides an OAuth-backed internal workspace: account management, Zanzibar-style policy tuples, documents, issues, settings, audit logs, optional DB-at-rest encryption, and JSON backup.

This document describes the implemented architecture in the current codebase. Planned integrations should live in separate roadmap or planning documents, not in current-state architecture docs.

In examples below, `${BASE_PATH}` is the configured URL prefix. Empty by default — leave the placeholder as `""` when reading the routes for a root-mounted deploy.

## Runtime Shape

```text
Browser
  |
  | ${BASE_PATH}/*
  v
App server
  |
  | ${BASE_PATH}/api/*
  v
Hono API
  |
  +-- public routes (always on: /health, /encryption/status)
  +-- setup routes (locked-only: /encryption/init, /unlock, /unlock-challenge)
  +-- protected routes guarded by requireUnlocked (unlocked-only business + admin)
  +-- SQLite via Drizzle ORM
```

The outer app serves:

| Mount | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/` | HTML meta refresh to `${BASE_PATH}/` when `BASE_PATH` is set. Skipped when the app is root-mounted — the SPA already owns `/`. |
| `${BASE_PATH}/api` | Hono API. |
| `${BASE_PATH}/*` | Embedded SPA assets when production assets are present. |

## Request Flow

```text
Request
  -> request ID (+ propagation for outbound calls)
  -> CORS
  -> app context injection (db, config, logger, encryption)
  -> request logging
  -> CSRF guard
  -> policy middleware (auto-gates routes declared via defineResource.routes)
  -> route group
  -> requireUnlocked for protected routes
  -> authRequired where the module requires a session
  -> adminRequired where the module requires admin privileges
  -> handler
  -> shared error handler
```

## Authentication Flow

```text
Unauthenticated user
  -> GET /app/api/account/auth/login
  -> OAuth authorization endpoint
  -> GET /app/api/account/auth/callback
  -> token exchange with PKCE verifier
  -> local user create/update
  -> session cookie
  -> redirect back to requested page
```

Sessions are stored in SQLite. The browser stores only the HTTP-only session cookie.

### Session token storage

Each session row carries the upstream OAuth `access_token` and `refresh_token` as plain columns. Their protection at rest depends on `DB_ENCRYPTION`:

| `DB_ENCRYPTION` | At-rest protection for session tokens |
|---|---|
| `true` (recommended for production) | libsql encrypts the whole SQLite file with the DEK; rows are unreadable without the master key. |
| `false` (template default — dev convenience) | Tokens live as cleartext SQL strings in `app.db`. Anyone with read access to the file (filesystem, snapshot, leaked backup) gets the tokens. |

For deployments that disable encryption (e.g. local dev, or a single-tenant box where the file is already covered by full-disk encryption) this trade-off is acceptable. If sessions must be defensible even when an attacker can read `app.db`, run with `DB_ENCRYPTION=true` or wrap the columns at the application layer before persisting. Drizzle's `defaultFn` is a reasonable seam.

`DEFAULT_ADMIN` is the bootstrap input: whenever the user table contains no rows with `role=admin`, the next login matching the configured username or email is promoted. Non-admin users may sign up at any time without locking the bootstrap window — the gate is on admin presence, not on user-count zero.

OAuth/OIDC provider configuration is read from environment variables at runtime. The admin settings UI does not own these values, which prevents a bad database setting from breaking login.

## Authorization Model

The policy module stores relation tuples in `relation_tuples` and exposes check and expand operations. Admin users bypass policy checks where the route explicitly uses `adminRequired`.

Tuple example:

```text
document:abc123#viewer@group:dev-team#member
group:dev-team#member@user:user123
```

## Rate Limiting

Two limiters, chosen by whether the window has to outlive the process.

**In-memory, IP-keyed** — `shared/middleware/rate-limit.ts`, backed by the
platform key/value seam. Free per request, so it suits short windows on
unauthenticated surfaces. `consumeRateLimit` is the single implementation of
the fixed-window counter: `rateLimit()` wraps it as middleware for TOTP
step-up, and the auth and encryption routes call it directly where they need
to gate part of a handler rather than the whole route. State is lost on
restart, which is acceptable for these windows because the control that
actually stops credential brute force is `auth_lockouts`, below.

**Durable, user-keyed** — `shared/middleware/creation-rate-limit.ts`,
backed by the `rate_limits` table. Creation is the surface where an
authenticated caller can grow the database without bound, and a counter that
dies with the process would let a caller pace requests around a restart — or,
on a runtime that evicts the app when idle, around the eviction.

The middleware is mounted once and finds the creating routes itself, rather
than being wired into each one. The rule is the REST invariant the whole
route table already follows: a collection answers `GET` with a list and
`POST` with a create, so a `POST` whose path also has a `GET` creates a
member of that collection, while an action posted at a member
(`/cron/jobs/:id/trigger`, `/policy/check`) has no matching `GET` and is left
alone. A new module is therefore throttled the moment it mounts, with
nothing to remember and no central list to maintain — and
`creation-rate-limit.test.ts` pins the discovered set, so a route entering or
leaving it has to be acknowledged.

Budgets are per resource, not global: `issue`, `document`, `comment`,
`attachment` and the rest each carry their own counter, so a burst of
comments does not spend the budget for opening issues and a runaway loop in
one module cannot lock a user out of the rest of the app. All three
attachment endpoints land on `attachment` because they create the same kind
of thing. `CREATE_RATE_LIMIT_EXEMPT` lists resources to leave alone.

Two windows apply together. `CREATE_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE` bounds a burst;
`CREATE_RATE_LIMIT_PER_HOUR` bounds the sustained rate that a burst limit
alone would still allow — at 60/minute, an unbounded hour is 3600 creates.
Rejected requests keep counting, so a caller hammering the minute limit
escalates into the hour window instead of settling into a comfortable rhythm
just under the burst cap. A 429 reports the longest tripped window in
`Retry-After`.

Both windows are bumped by one upsert, so concurrent requests cannot lose an
increment and the two cannot drift apart. Keying on the user id bounds the
table to users × resources × windows, one row each, overwritten in place, so
no sweep is needed.

Login has a third control that is neither: `auth_lockouts` records failures
per username in the database, which is what actually stops credential
stuffing from a rotating set of addresses. The same table backs the TOTP
verification lockout.

The two long windows — `/encryption/unlock` at 10 per 15 minutes and
`/encryption/init` at 5 per 15 minutes — are the only ones where losing
in-memory state would matter, and they are reachable only on an encrypted
deployment, which needs the `encryptionAtRest` capability and therefore a
long-lived process. Every window reachable on a runtime that evicts the app
when idle is either a minute long or has a database-backed control beneath
it.

## Encryption Lifecycle

The app can start in a locked mode. Setup and unlock routes are available before the full protected app is mounted. After unlock, protected routes are mounted and guarded by `requireUnlocked`.

## Data Storage

Runtime data is stored below `ROOT_DIR`:

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `data/db/app.db` | SQLite database. |
| `data/db/app.pid` | PID lock file. |
| `data/logs/app.log` | Structured JSON logs. |
